**Coffee-Health-Consumption-Insights-Dashboard**
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing coffee consumption, health metrics, and lifestyle habits. Reveals demographic trends, wellness patterns, and actionable recommendations based on real-world data.

📄 **Statement of Purpose**  
This project explores the relationship between **coffee consumption, demographics, health metrics, and lifestyle habits using Power BI**.  
The purpose of this dashboard is to demonstrate how data analytics can reveal patterns and actionable insights in the wellness, nutrition, and health space — an area I am passionate about and actively researching.


📊  **Project Overview**

This repository contains my **Power BI dashboards** that visualize:  
- Coffee intake across **age groups, genders, and countries**  
- Links between **coffee intake and health metrics** such as sleep, stress, heart rate, and BMI  
- Connections between **lifestyle habits** (physical activity, smoking, alcohol use) and coffee consumption  
- An interactive profile of a **“typical high coffee consumer”**

## 🔎 Key Insights from the Dashboards  

### 1. Demographics  
- **Age Groups**: Young and middle-aged adults consume slightly more coffee than older adults.  
- **Gender**: Nearly even split — ~48% Male, ~50% Female, ~2% Other.  
- **Countries**: Top coffee-consuming countries include **Spain, UK, USA, Switzerland**; lower consumption in **Canada and Belgium**.  
- **Occupation**: **Healthcare professionals** are the top coffee consumers, followed by students and service workers.

### 2. Health Metrics  
- **Sleep**: Higher coffee intake correlates with slightly fewer sleep hours.  
- **Heart Rate**: Relatively stable across moderate caffeine intake but spikes at the highest levels.  
- **Stress**: High-stress individuals consume more caffeine; intake decreases as stress drops.  
- **BMI**: Overweight respondents tend to drink more coffee on average.

### 3. Lifestyle Habits  
- **Physical Activity**: Moderate coffee intake among active individuals; slight differences across activity levels.  
- **Smoking & Alcohol**: Higher coffee intake is often accompanied by higher smoking or alcohol consumption in certain groups.

### 4. High Coffee Consumer Profile  
- **Most Common Age Group**: 25–40 years  
- **Occupation**: Healthcare / Student / Service Industry  
- **Habits**: Slightly lower sleep hours, moderate-to-high stress, above-average caffeine intake  
- **Lifestyle**: More likely to consume alcohol or smoke compared to lower coffee consumers  


## 💡 Recommendations  
- **For Employers/HR**: Provide stress management and wellness initiatives for high-stress, high-caffeine roles (like healthcare).  
- **For Health Researchers**: Investigate causal links between coffee consumption, stress, and sleep to guide public health messaging.  
- **For Lifestyle Coaches/Nutritionists**: Use caffeine intake as a potential marker for sleep or stress issues in clients.  
- **For Further Analysis**:  
  - Explore differences within occupations or regions more deeply.  
  - Examine longitudinal patterns if time-series data is available.  
  - Segment the dataset to identify “at-risk” populations based on lifestyle and health indicators.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI Desktop** (Data Visualization)  
- **DAX** (for calculated measures and KPIs)  
- **Power Query** (data cleaning and shaping)
